INTRODUCTION					*smartchr-introduction*

Smartchr is a Vim plugin to support input several candidates with a single
key, like ess-smart-underscore in Emacs Speaks Statistics -- when user types
"_" key, it inserts " <- " for the first time or it replaces " <- " by "_" for
the second time.  This plugin provides a function to support to define such
key bindings.

Requirements:
- Vim 7.1 or later.

INTERFACE					*smartchr-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONS					*smartchr-functions*

						*smartchr#one_of()*
smartchr#one_of(...)
	Returns a string which represents the key sequence to insert one of
	the given arguments.  For example, the following setting emulates
	ess-smart-underscore in Emacs Speaks Statistics:
>
		inoremap <expr> _  smartchr#one_of(' <- ', '_')
<
	With the above setting, when user types "_" key, " <- " is inserted
	for the first time.  When user types "_" key again, the previously
	inserted " <- " is removed, then "_" is inserted.

	More generally, this function returns the key sequence to:
	- insert the 1st argument for the 1st time, or
	- replace the 1st argument by the 2nd argument for the 2nd time, or
	- ...
	- replace the {N-1}th argument by the {N}th argument for the {N}th
	  time.
