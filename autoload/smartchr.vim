function! smartchr#one_of(...)  "{{{2
  " Support function to insert one of the given arguments like
  " ess-smart-underscore of Emacs Speaks Statistics.
  "
  " For example, the following setting emulates ess-smart-underscore:
  "
  "   inoremap <expr> _  <SID>smart_char(' <- ', '_')
  "
  " With the above setting, when user types "_" key, " <- " is inserted for
  " the first time.  When user types "_" key again, the previously inserted
  " " <- " is replaced by "_".
  "
  " More generally, this function returns the key sequence to:
  " - Insert a:1 for the first time.
  " - Delete a:1 then insert a:2 for the second time.
  " - Delete a:{N-1} then insert a:{N} for the Nth time.

  for i in range(len(a:000) - 1, 1, -1)
    let literal1 = a:000[i]
    let literal2 = a:000[i-1]

    if search('\V' . escape(literal2, '\') . '\%#', 'bcn')
      return (pumvisible() ? "\<C-e>" : '')
           \ . repeat("\<BS>", len(literal2))
           \ . literal1
    endif
  endfor

  return a:1
